When we tried to polish up the project 2 days ago, we realised that the format of our output did not fit the format of submission. In fact it was very different. For example our stack grew in an ascending fashion. When we combined our upward growing function stack with the downward-growing, gcc main stack, there were obvious clashes. Furthermore, we used a fixed offset from 0 for the absolute addresses of our global variables. This caused segmentation faults and as a result we used the .word directive to store globals. In general, we had no clue about directives and as a result received relentless segmentation faults. To fix this, we did research into directives and implemented them in our code. 

As of today we are passing most tests. The act of stopping and submitting is slightly arbitrary as we are finding smaller and smaller bugs. In terms of time requirement, we have solely worked on this project for around 9-10 hours a day since the last update. We will aim to fully finish by tomorrow. This will still be 5 days before the final submission due date.
