On the previous time management update, we set a goal to finish on Mar 18. It is March 20 and we have finished. We might add little bits  here and there (finish parsing *, & and arrays)but the vast majority of our compiler has been completed. The reason for the 2 day delay was a direct result of both of us having interviews for internships and Maths CW submissions to worry about. However by our standards, completing a deadline a week before the submission is a completely novel experience. To have finished by this time, we put in five 9-11 hour days solely working on the compiler in the last week.

We will plan to make tomorrow our last day on the compiler. We plan to spend 8-9 hours going over small details and testing nuanced cases. On the day after tomorrow, we will make our final submission and start revision for exams.

In the last week we have figured out a highly effective teamwork dynamic. At the beginning of the day we will meet for 30 minutes to discuss precisely what both of us will do by the end of the day. Then we will work in close proximity to each other so that we can ask each other questions. However, we don't work so close that we get distracted by each other therefore perhaps we choose different spots in the library. At the end of the day we report our work for around 10 minutes. This has led to a low-distraction, highly efficient work style.
