Functional features:

a file containing just a single function with no arguments.
variables of int type.
local variables.
arithmetic and logical expressions.
if-then-else statements.
while loops.

intermediate:

files containing multiple functions that call each other
functions that take up to four parameters
for loops
arrays declared globally (i.e. outside of any function in your file)
arrays declared locally (i.e. inside a function)
reading and writing elements of an array
recursive function calls
the enum keyword
the break and continue keywords

advanced:

calling externally-defined functions
mutually recursive function calls
locally scoped variable declarations
